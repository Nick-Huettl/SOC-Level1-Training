## Experience:

As someone looking to eventually become a SOC Analyst, I was very interested in TryHackMe's SOC Level 1 Learning Path to gain some hands-on experience with tools. The path covered many different industry tools and frameworks, providing a great hands-on experience with some familiar tools, as well as unfamiliar tools. Some of the tools that were used include WireShark, TShark, Wazuh, OSQuery, ELK, Splunk, Autopsy, and Velociraptor. While there are others besides the ones listed, it was a great experience to revisit some of the tools I was familiar with, while also learning about tools I have never even heard of.
